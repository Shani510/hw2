As last week, my project is a website for some hand made products my friend makes. I included some description about the idea in 'about us' and examples of prodects under 'products'. 
This time I was able to make the website a little prettier using Tailwind. I added color (purple), typography, borders, sizing (to pictures), box model, layout (using flexbox (and even adjusted for iphone X size), and responsive design (added a form to register to a newsletter). I hope you enjoy my site!
